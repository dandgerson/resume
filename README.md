## Dmitry G. Anderson

Hello, I'm Dmitry G. Anderson - Software Developer and JavaScript Enthusiast.
I'm in love with JavaScript programming language and building graphical web interfaces. Since November 2016 I dropped all of my others and began training my hard skills in Frontend Development and JavaScript like a weightlifter on steroids before starts.

I want growing up as much faster as its can and if you can load me cool js frontend stuff ***- I'm ready for job!***

If being more precisely, I ideally dream to building cool and complicated web apps, pumping up my brain with programming hard skills, learn more other cool hard frontend stuff, get awesome middle / senior mentor, and deep dive in cool project surrounded with my like-minded people.
